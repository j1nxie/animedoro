# animedoro

a simple pomodoro clock, adhering to the animedoro technique!

## what's the animedoro technique?

it's similar to the normal 25+5 pomodoro, but here, you work for 40-60 minutes (default set for this very clock is 45 minutes) and take a 25-minute break to watch an anime episode!

## usage

right now it's only available from source, sorry :( you will need zig and raylib installed on your system.

1. clone the git repository
2. `zig build run` to start the clock!

the configuration file is dumped to `config.dat` at your present working directory.
